********************CheerUp App*********************
For project two I am creating an app that lets people bring a little happy into other people's 
lives by thinking of them and sending them an inspiring, 
cheerful or profund quote with this cheerUp App. This came from an idea mentioned in the project 
two guidlines. I always save good quotes that I hear and 
have been know to send my friends inspiring quotes especially if I know they're going through a 
tough time/ and also for no reason at all!


I will be using they said so api 
https://theysaidso.com/api


Basic functionality:
User will be able to login with email and encrypted password.
User will be able to delete their account
User will be able to search for a quote, pick a quote, pick a background image or not and send the 
quote to a friend by email.

stretch goal.. other ways to send quotes. Ideally text message or pop up alert on your phone.
